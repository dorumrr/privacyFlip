Privacy Flip automatically manages your device's privacy features based on screen lock/unlock state. When you lock your device, it can disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile data, location services, NFC, and even camera/microphone sensors. When you unlock, it intelligently restores the features you want back on.
