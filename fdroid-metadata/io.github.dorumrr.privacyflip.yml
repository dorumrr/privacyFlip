Summary: Automatic privacy control for rooted Android devices

Description: |
    PrivacyFlip automatically manages your device's privacy features based on screen lock/unlock state. 
    When you lock your device, it disables Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mobile data, and location services. 
    When you unlock, it intelligently restores the features you want back on.

    '''Features:'''
    * Automatic privacy control on screen lock/unlock
    * Configurable feature control (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile Data, Location)
    * Customizable timing delays (0-300 seconds for lock, 0-60 seconds for unlock)
    * Background service for persistent monitoring
    * Quick Settings tile integration
    * Material 3 design with dark theme support
    * Comprehensive logging and debugging

    '''Privacy Features Controlled:'''
    * Wi-Fi - Disable/enable wireless connectivity
    * Bluetooth - Control Bluetooth radio
    * Mobile data - Manage cellular data connection
    * Location services - Control GPS and location tracking

    '''Requirements:'''
    * Root access (Magisk, SuperSU, or similar)
    * Android 5.0+ (API level 21)

    The app requires root permissions to control system-level privacy features. 
    All privacy actions are performed locally on the device with no data transmission.
